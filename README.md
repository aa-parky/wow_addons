Just some simple addons for Classic WoW as I learn a little about lua.

# Lights 'nd Pike's Compendium of Stuff

### Thankful

> Although Pike has been known to eat his victims he is actually a conscientious
soul. His mind, as you know is a little, shall we say, all over the place and
normally misses the opportunity to thank those that provided him a buff or two.


Thankful writes to chat the last player's name and the buff they applied. You can 
**choose** to click on the name and send them a friendly whisper.

I have chosen **not** to automate the response as I feel something like this should be
used by discretion.

#### Todo
- [X] Send last player's name to buff you to chat
- [ ] Create a pre-populated list of responses based on faction, race, gender etc that populates say or whisper if chosen by the player

### No! This One

> Lights has always been to eager to chuck spells around quite willy nilly to be honest. This my adventurer just will not do!

No! This one is a simple addon that you can use when grouped up with a bunch of unhinged
and unknown strangers to automatically apply a raid marker to your target. Best be quick
and the first to target eh?

Go get a killin'

#### Todo

- [x] Automatically assign the next raid marker to your target
- [x] /clm clear last marker
- [x] /noon turn addon on
- [x] /noof turn addon off
